      <di><dt><strong>2012-10-09: Registration Re-Opened</strong></dt><dd>We have re-opened account registration at &lt;<a href='https://register.jabber.org/'>https://register.jabber.org/</a>&gt;.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-09-25: Updated Service Policy</strong></dt><dd>Version 1.1 of the jabber.org service policy is now in effect.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-22: Disabled Accounts</strong></dt><dd>Recently the jabber.org IM service has been the victim of massive and repeated denial of service attacks. The admin team strongly suspects that these attacks are related to the widespread and abusive use of jabber.org accounts by "customers" of KBot, a program for cheating at the DarkOrbit game. Even if the DoS attacks prove to be unrelated to KBot, the admin team has decided that use of jabber.org to communicate with KBot violates the jabber.org service policy. Although we are in the process of updating the service policy to more clearly define how this kind of usage is abusive, the dire nature of the current threat has forced us to take more immediate action. Therefore, we are disabling the accounts of every jabber.org user who communicates with KBot, and we have disabled new account registration to prevent further communication between jabber.org users and KBot. We do not take this step lightly, but given the current circumstances we have no other choice.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-22: Account Registration Disabled</strong></dt><dd>As part of our defensive measures against repeated DoS attacks, we have disabled new account registration until further notice.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-21: Another Denial of Service</strong></dt><dd>The previous DDoS attack has started again. As before, fallback measures are in place, but if your IM client doesn't handle DNS SRV records correctly then you might not be able to connect.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-20: Proposed Changes to the Service Policy</strong></dt><dd>We have posted proposed changes to the policy that governs use of the jabber.org IM service. Details, links, and instructions for providing feedback can be found in our post to the juser@jabber.org email list, see <a href='http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/juser/2012-August/006869.html'>http://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/juser/2012-August/006869.html</a>.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-15: Service Restored</strong></dt><dd>We were able to completely restore service today. However, it is quite possible that the denial of service attack could be launched again at any time. If you were unable to connect during the outage, we recommend that you consider using a different IM client or reporting a bug to the developers of the IM client you use, since standard DNS fallback and XMPP reconnection methods should have been sufficient to keep you online after the first few hours of the attack.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-12: Denial of Service</strong></dt><dd>Today we have experienced a distributed denial of service attack against the jabber.org IM service. Although the web server and email server are running fine, we have been forced to take the IM service offline until your (volunteer!) admin team has time to determine appropriate countermeasures. UPDATE 2012-08-12: We've made some DNS fixes and some clients are now able to connect.</dd></di>
