      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-15: Service Restored</strong></dt><dd>We were able to completely restore service today. However, it is quite possible that the denial of service attack could be launched again at any time. If you were unable to connect during the outage, we recommend that you consider using a different IM client or reporting a bug to the developers of the IM client you use, since standard DNS fallback and XMPP reconnection methods should have been sufficient to keep you online after the first day or so of the attack.</dd></di>
      <di><dt><strong>2012-08-12: Denial of Service</strong></dt><dd>Today we have experienced a distributed denial of service attack against the jabber.org IM service. Although the web server and email server are running fine, we have been forced to take the IM service offline until your (volunteer!) admin team has time to determine appropriate countermeasures. UPDATE 2012-08-12: We've made some DNS fixes and some clients are now able to connect.</dd></di>
