# Jabber.org Renaissance

Version 0.2, 2017-01-27

## Vision

We intend for Jabber.org to be the leading open system for personal communication.

## Strategy

By the end of 2017, create a cohesive team, self-sustaining organization,
scalable service, and highly usable interface for personal communication.

## Goals

### Team

The foundation for achieving our vision is not an organizational structure
or a technological platform, but our team. It is all-important that we
build a cohesive team with high trust, candid communication, commitment 
to common goals and values, accountability to each other and our users, 
and a drive for results.

### Organization

Since 1999, Jabber.org has been a completely volunteer effort that has 
depended on the kindness of friends (such as USSHC for hosting and more 
recently Isode for software and a server donation). The service needs to
become self-sustaining financially and organizationally, yet with an 
appropriate incentive structure for team members to contribute their 
time and energy (most likely as a workers cooperative). 

### Service

Our primary offering is a free service for personal communication, as of
early 2017 with over 1 million registered users. We intend to greatly 
increase the number of people we serve (e.g., to 10 million).

### Interface

The usability of Jabber/XMPP software applications and services is simply not
good enough. We have an opportunity and responsibility to vastly improve the 
user experience for people who use our service. We will do so by sponsoring
work on existing mobile and desktop applications, or by creating our own apps
especially where coverage is weak (e.g., on Windows).

## Values

### Pragmatic Idealism

We are pragmatic idealists who strive to efficiently produce usable software
applications and provide a useful communication service.

### Privacy and Security

We feel a strong moral obligation to provide software and services that deeply 
respect the privacy and security of personal communications.

### Integrity

We act with integrity and respect for our users by interacting in a humane way 
(e.g., by informing individual users of government requests related to their 
account activity). We also strive to protect the integrity of the service in 
the face of external attacks, reported abuse, and fraud.

## Transparency

We are committed to transparency in all aspects of our operation:

- Open Standards: We use XMPP technologies as the basis for our platform. If 
  needed to provide features that our users desire, we will define additional 
  open standards, typically as extensions to XMPP.

- Open Source: We use liberally-licensed (e.g., MIT/BSD) software code that is 
  open to inspection and easy to understand.

- Open Deployment: We document how we build and deploy our software to 
  further increase confidence and trust in our service.

- Open Management: We regularly provide insights into decisions that our team
  makes regarding technology and organization, and we encourage and listen to
  community input on these topics.

- Open Books: We disclose all financial aspects of our operation.

## Projects & High-Level Tasks

### Build the Team

- define a competency model to help us add the right people to the team

- define roles and job descriptions to improve clarity

- recruit 3-5 core team members

### Create the Organization

- decide on organizational form and legal status (workers cooperative?)

- establish bank account

- obtain seed funding (on the order of $10,000)

- legally establish the organization

- define founding documents (charter, articles of incorporation, and bylaws)
  and obtain legal review

- set up system for receiving donations from users

- determine whether to seek larger grants and organizational donations

### Solidify the Service

- migrate to Prosody or other open-source server code

- re-open user registration

- encrypt all data at rest (user credentials, rosters, message archives)

- define and deploy methods for supporting end users

- define and deploy initial anti-spam measures (e.g., a reputation system)

- define and deploy initial attack protections (e.g., against DDoS botnets)

### Make it Usable

- create user-friendly onboarding experience and documentation

- create a list of existing end-user apps to recommend

- create a rank-ordered list of supported end-user platforms

- seek out usability expertise and contract for usability testing

- create project plans for improving existing apps

- create project plans for building any new apps

### Scale it Up

- define metrics for success (e.g., number of registered users, number of
  simultaneous users, sign-ups per week, connected servers, media mentions)

- define audiences to which we'd like to promote the service

- promote the service 

- measure the effectiveness of promotional efforts and continually 
  improve them
